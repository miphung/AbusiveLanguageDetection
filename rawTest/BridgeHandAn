Members(ent1) of the rhinoceros family(e1lab1PP) are(ent1cop1) some of the largest(e1prop1) remaining(e1prop2) megafauna(e1lab2), with all species(e1lab3) able to reach(act1) or exceed(act2) one tonne(e1prop3) in weight.
They(e1lab4arg0)) have(e1act3) a herbivorous diet(e1prop4), small brains(e1prop5) (400–600 g) for mammals of their size(e1lab5), one or two horns(e1prop6), and a thick (1.5–5 cm) protective skin(e1prop7) formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure(describes skin?/not relevant.
They(e1lab4arg0) generally eat(e1act4) leafy material(arg1), although their(e1lab4arg0) ability to ferment food in their hindgut(e1prop8) allows(e1act6) them(e1lab4) to subsist(e1act7) on more fibrous plant matter when necessary.
Unlike other perissodactyls(e1lab5), the two African(e1prop9) species(e1lab5) of rhinoceros lack(e1act8) teeth at the front of their mouths(prop10), relying instead on their lips(e1prop11) to pluck(e1act9) food.
Rhinoceros(e1coref1arg1) are killed(act1) by some humans(ent2arg0) for their horns(ent1prop12), which are bought and sold on the black market, and used by some cultures for ornaments or traditional medicine.
East Asia(ent3), specifically Vietnam(ent4 or ent3coref1), is(ent3cop1) the largest market(e3prop1) for rhino horns(ent5?).
By weight, rhino horns(ent5arg0) cost(ent5act1) as much as gold on the black market.
People(ent2coref1arg0) grind up(ent2act2) the horns(ent5arg1) and consume(e2act3) them(e5coref1), believing the dust has therapeutic properties.
The horns(ent5) are(e5cop2?) made of keratin(e5prop1), the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails.
Both African(e1prop9) species(e1lab5) and the Sumatran(e6lab1) rhinoceros(e6 or e1?) have two horns, while the Indian(e1lab and Javan(e1lab) rhinoceros(e1coref1) have a single horn.
The IUCN(ent7) Red List identifies(e7act1) the Black(e1lab10), Javan(e1lab11), and Sumatran(e1lab12) rhinoceros(e1coref1) as critically endangered(e1prop12).
